# Introduction to Deep Learning

First course of the specialization [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml?). The Course itself can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning?specialization=aml). Tasks and utility functions can be found on [this](https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl) official course repository.

## Description
The goal of this course is to give learners basic understanding of modern neural networks and their applications in computer vision and natural language understanding. The course starts with a recap of linear models and discussion of stochastic optimization methods that are crucial for training deep neural networks. Learners will study all popular building blocks of neural networks including fully connected layers, convolutional and recurrent layers. 
Learners will use these building blocks to define complex modern architectures in TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. In the course project learner will implement deep neural network for the task of image captioning which solves the problem of giving a text description for an input image.
