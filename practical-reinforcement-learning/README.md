## Description
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning course. 

Here you will find out about:

- foundations of RL methods: value/policy iteration, q-learning, policy gradient, etc. - with math & batteries included

- using deep neural networks for RL tasks - also known as "the hype train"

- state of the art RL algorithms - and how to apply duct tape to them for practical problems.

- and, of course, teaching your neural network to play games - because that's what everyone thinks RL is about. We'll also use it for seq2seq and contextual bandits.

Jump in. It's gonna be fun!
